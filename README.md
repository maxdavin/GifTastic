# GifTastic

*Created an array around video games/characters

*After that, worked on creating the function that creates and renders the buttons for the existing array.

*From there focused on the function that actually generates gifs when the buttons are pressed
-Accomplished this by researching multiple class activities, primarily focusing on the several that focused on using the Giphy API.

*The next step was creating the function that allows the user to click on the gif to animate them and then pause them again.

*Finally making it able so you can enter something into a form that generates a new button off of that word and then having gifs generated.
